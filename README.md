This repository contains a simple C program that illustrates a common error involving pointers. The program intends to modify the value of a variable indirectly using a pointer. However, the code contains a subtle error that may not be immediately obvious, particularly to less experienced C programmers. This is a great example for beginners learning about pointers. The solution provided demonstrates the correct way to handle pointer assignment and modification.  The intention is educational; the code and solution focus on addressing a crucial concept in C.
